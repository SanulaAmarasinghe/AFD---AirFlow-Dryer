# Waste Garment Dryer Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on designing a more efficient dryer to dry waste garments. The primary objective was to improve the drying process by increasing the drying capacity, reducing power consumption, and minimizing transportation and destruction costs. The proposed solution involves connecting the dryer to the exhaust fans of dye machines, using no electricity for heating, and instead using the heat generated from the exhaust fans.

## Problem Statement

Existing drying methods use a household dryer with a limited capacity (7 kg per cycle), which is inefficient for drying large quantities of waste garments. The drying process is slow, consumes a lot of electricity, and incurs high transportation costs due to frequent cycles.

## Proposed Solution

- **Dryer Connection to Exhaust Fans**: We connected the dryer to the exterior part of an exhaust fan in the dye machine area. The heat from the exhaust fans, which would normally be wasted, is used to heat the garments.
- **Capacity Increase**: The drum of the new dryer was designed with a capacity of 120 kg to accommodate a larger volume of garments per cycle.
- **Stainless-Steel Mesh Surface**: The surface of the drum was designed with a stainless-steel mesh to ensure heat distribution while ensuring the exhaust fans continue to perform optimally.

## Project Objectives

1. Increase the amount of waste garments processed per day by removing water weight faster.
2. Reduce power consumption per day by eliminating the need for electricity for heating.
3. Cover the daily total received (120 kg).
4. Reduce the time consumed after the installation of the dryer.
5. Reduce the frequency of transportation from 3 turns per day to 1 turn per day.

## Features

- **Energy-Efficient**: The system uses exhaust heat instead of electricity for heating.
- **Increased Capacity**: With a 120 kg capacity drum, the dryer can handle more garments per cycle.
- **Time Reduction**: The drying time is significantly reduced, allowing for faster garment drying.
- **Cost Savings**: Electricity costs and transportation costs are reduced.

## Installation

1. Connect the dryer to the exhaust fans in the dye machine area.
2. Ensure that the stainless-steel mesh surface is installed correctly to allow for proper heat distribution.
3. Set up the dryer to rotate the drum and evenly distribute the heat across the garments.
4. Ensure proper calibration to accommodate the 120 kg capacity per cycle.
